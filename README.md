# Hospital-Management-System
Welcome to the Hospital Management System GitHub repository! This project is a robust and efficient Java-based application designed to manage hospital operations seamlessly. Developed within a span of just 4 hours, this system employs key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, showcasing a mastery of concepts such as Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Data Abstraction.

Key Features:

Polymorphism: The project leverages polymorphism to provide flexibility and scalability in managing various hospital entities. This allows for easy extension and modification of the system to accommodate future requirements.

Inheritance: Through the use of inheritance, the codebase is structured hierarchically, promoting code reuse and minimizing redundancy. This ensures a clean and maintainable architecture that adheres to best practices.

Data Abstraction: The implementation of data abstraction enhances the system's security and encapsulation, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information. This ensures that only essential details are exposed, promoting a secure and well-structured design.

Custom Exception Handling: The project incorporates custom exception handling to manage errors effectively. This not only enhances the system's reliability but also provides meaningful error messages, aiding in troubleshooting and debugging.

JDBC Connectivity: The seamless integration of a SQL database with the Java program is achieved through JDBC connectivity. This ensures efficient data management, enabling the system to store and retrieve information from the database with optimal performance.
